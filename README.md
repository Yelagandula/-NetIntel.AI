# -NetIntel.AI
NetIntel.AI is a proof-of-concept platform built to demonstrate secure integration between LLM-based agents (e.g., OpenAI) and remote inference servers. It simulates how autonomous agents can interact with private infrastructure using a secure, lightweight networking layer.


# NetIntel.AI ‚Äì Secure Agent Orchestration Platform

> ‚ö°Ô∏è Proof-of-concept framework to securely connect autonomous LLM agents to remote inference servers through a lightweight, simulated VPN mesh.

---

## üåê Overview

**NetIntel.AI** demonstrates secure orchestration of LLM-based agents (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama) across remote cloud inference environments. It uses a simulated mesh VPN (WireGuard-based) to route agent commands via a secure backend, visualized through an interactive dashboard.
